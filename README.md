## 🧠 How the Game Works

- The game board consists of 9 clickable boxes arranged in a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns marking the boxes with either `X` or `O`.
- After every move, the game checks for a winning combination or a draw.
- Once the game ends, a message is shown:
  - 🎉 “Congratulations, Winner is X/O”
  - ⚖️ “Game was a Draw.”
- Players can reset the game at any time using the buttons provided.
